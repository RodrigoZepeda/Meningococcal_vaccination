Notes:

	These are weekly cases of selected infectious 
	national notifiable diseases, from the 
	National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).  
	NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, 
	and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables. 
	Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are 
	subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting.
	Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to 
	these counts as additional information becomes available. 
	Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week.
